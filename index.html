    <h1>DNA: The Blueprint of Life</h1>
    <p>
      DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material that carries genetic instructions essential for the growth,
      development, functioning, and reproduction of all known living organisms and many viruses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Found mainly in the cell nucleus, DNA is composed of two strands forming a double helix, built from four nucleotide bases:
      adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine. These sequences encode information that directs the synthesis of proteins,
      which are critical for cellular structure and function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through processes like replication and mutation, DNA enables inheritance and contributes to genetic diversity,
      which drives evolution and adaptation in populations over time.
